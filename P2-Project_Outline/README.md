# Project Outline


### Overview
This project is a website for my pilates teacher Amy. For years, Amy has used a notebook and texting to keep up with her pilates appointments. She is not tech savvy, so I would like to build something that is easier for her to use and understand. 

This app will allow people to learn about pilates and Amy, to book an appointment, and to write and view reviews. 

### Features
1. New Client Intake Form: Users will be able to fill out a form with information if they are a new client of Amy's. 
2. Who is Amy?: Users will be able to learn about Amy through her bio, see what she looks like, and contact her.
3. What is Pilates?: Users will be able to learn about pilates--what it is and what it's like to do it with Amy. 
4. Service: Users will be able to view services Amy offers along with short descriptions. 
5. Payment: Users will be able to make payments for their classes and buy gift certificates. 

### Technologies
