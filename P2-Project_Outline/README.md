# Project Outline


### Overview
This project is a website for my pilates teacher Amy. For years, Amy has used a notebook and texting to keep up with her pilates appointments. She is not tech savvy, so I would like to build something that is easier for her to use and understand. 

This app will allow people to learn about pilates and Amy, to book an appointment, and to write and view reviews. 

### Features
1. Book Appointment: Users will be able to look at available appointments and book one that fits their schedule. 
2. Who is Amy?: Users will be able to learn about Amy through her bio, see what she looks like, and contact her.
3. What is Pilates?: Users will be able to learn about pilates--what it is and what it's like to do it with Amy. 
4. Reviews: Users will be able to view reviews people have written about Amy's classes and add their own reviews. 

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
